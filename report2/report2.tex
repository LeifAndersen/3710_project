\section{Instruction Set Design}
We decided to take an approach to our processor that is similar to x86 as well as the CR16.  Each instruction will be a fixed length of 16 bits, with instructions to take both immediate and registers, the result will then be stored back into the first register.

The following Op Codes have been implemented by our CPU:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item ADD
	\item ADDU
	\item ADDI
	\item ADDUI
	\item ADDCU
	\item ADDCUI
	\item SUB
	\item SUBI
	\item CMP
	\item CMPI
	\item TEST
	\item AND
	\item OR
	\item XOR
	\item NOT
	\item LSH
	\item LSHI
	\item RSH
	\item RSHI
	\item ALSH
	\item ARSH
	\item NOP
\end{enumerate}

The following instructions have not yet been implemented.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item MULT
	\item MULTI
	\item MULTU
	\item MULTUI
\end{enumerate}
