BaisCPU - A Simplified CPU for testing
ALU - The ALU project
Register - The register file
Models - blend files for drawable models
Assembler - Python scripts for assembly
FlagRegister - A special register for the ALU
Keyboard - The keyboard Controller
VGA - The VGA controller
Painter - The graphics hardware
PrimativeBRAM - The block rams
ALUZPostSynthesis - For debuggin
MainMem  - An instationation of PrimativeBRam for the CPU to use.
